He began his career as a classical philologist, turning to philosophy early in his academic career. In 1869, aged 24, Nietzsche became the youngest professor to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel. Plagued by health problems for most of his life, he resigned from the university in 1879, after which he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. Nietzsche's work spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. Prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favour of perspectivism; a genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality and a related theory of master–slave morality; the aesthetic affirmation of life in response to both the 'death of God' and the profound crisis of nihilism; the notion of Apollonian and Dionysian forces; and a characterisation of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. He also developed influential concepts such as the Übermensch and his doctrine of eternal return. In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome cultural and moral mores in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health. His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, music, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew inspiration from Greek tragedy as well as figures such as Zoroaster, Arthur Schopenhauer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Richard Wagner, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\",return_tensors='pt')\n","\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","  outputs = model(tokz,output_hidden_states=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"hfaEG1i27Kb9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["activations.keys(), activations['mlp_proj_0'].shape"],"metadata":{"id":"0aiE5UybVY9p"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(outputs.hidden_states), outputs.hidden_states[33].shape"],"metadata":{"id":"oxIvTEMA-v1t"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"ABc81HxrOVCj"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Exercise 2: Cosine similarities between attention and MLP"],"metadata":{"id":"xPI6KfMQOU_n"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# initialize\n","cossims = np.zeros((model.config.n_layer,len(tokz[0])))\n","\n","# loop over layers\n","for layeri in range(model.config.n_layer):\n","\n","  # cosine similarity between attn and mlp projections within layer\n","  for toki in range(len(tokz[0])):\n","\n","    # extract the two vectors for this tooken\n","    attn = activations[f'attn_proj_{layeri}'][0,toki,:].unsqueeze(0)\n","    mlp  = activations[f'mlp_proj_{layeri}'][0,toki,:].unsqueeze(0)\n","\n","    # cosine similarity between them\n","    cossims[layeri,toki] = torch.cosine_similarity(attn,mlp)\n","\n","\n","# plotting!
